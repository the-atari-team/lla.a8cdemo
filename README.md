# A8CLibrary

Atari 8 Bit Text Mode Windowing Library written in C by Wade Ripkowski.


This is the source code for ABBUC Magazin 156 demonstration.

There are 3 extra sub directories:

* a8clib - contains some, not all, files from Wade Ripkowski's famous A8CLib, only we need to build the demo.
* a8c-extensions - some extensions written by LarsImNetz
* demo - the demo.


To build, goto demo directory and start with make.

It needs the cc65 in directory `/usr/local/src/cc65` installed.
Also `atari800` should be available in `$PATH` variable.

More information, find in ABBUC Magazin 156
